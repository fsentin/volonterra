### BSc Thesis
##### Fani Sentinella-JerbiÄ‡, 2021

This thesis aimed to offer a technological solution for engaging society in volunteering. The offered solution is a multi-platform information system that connects interested volunteers and organizations that need volunteers in a fast, simple, and likable way. Existing information systems for volunteering were studied, and the main functional and non-functional requirements of the system were
defined. The architecture of the system was designed based on the REST architectural style. Implemented parts of the system are the mobile application made in Flutter and the server application made in Spring Boot. The created system was analyzed by the system requirements and the user experience survey.
